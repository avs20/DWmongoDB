How is the auditing done. 


1. Identify an area which I want to audit?

2. Take the sample.osm

3. Find the values regarding to the area chosen in Step 1.

4. Take a look at the values. See if there are some non conforming values . If they exist then 

5. Make a process to make these non conforming values conforming. Just create a function that will detect the non conforming values and will return a 
   conforming value. 
   
6. Repeat step 1-5 for atleast 3 areas.

7. Now run the complete osm file and detect the non conforming values : convert them to correct values using your function : write to json file. 

8. Upload the json data to mongoDB

9. Run some analytic queries on the mongoDB. 

10. Publish the results in a html file and Submit to Udacity.
